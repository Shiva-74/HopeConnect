    # Currently, our matching engine (weighted_scorer.py) is largely rule-based
    # and doesn't require explicit model training in the traditional sense.
    # Preprocessing steps for the weighted scorer are embedded in its logic or
    # in the matching_engine.preprocessor.py (for things like HLA, blood type).

    # If we had a machine learning model *for matching* (e.g., predicting a
    # match quality score directly, rather than the rule-based weighted_scorer),

    # that would be used by a hypothetical ML-based matching model:
