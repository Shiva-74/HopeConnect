HopeConnect: Decentralized, AI-Driven Organ-Donation Matching & Transparency Platform  

*Connecting Last Hopes With New Beginnings*

HopeConnect is a *blockchain-powered, **AI-driven* platform that transforms India’s organ donation ecosystem by enabling *secure, transparent, and real-time matching* of donors and recipients.

Over *300,000 patients* in India await transplants, yet *20+ lives are lost daily* due to outdated systems, poor logistics, and lack of trust. HopeConnect bridges this life-threatening gap through Ethereum smart contracts, predictive AI models, and automated logistics coordination.
